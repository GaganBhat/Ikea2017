## Ikea 2017 Robot Code

FRC 2017 Java code which is underdevelopment for the Ikea 2017 robot. Mainly used for eexperimentation with new and unvisited features to-be implemented in main competition. 

## Current Features

- Command based control system.
- Custom incremental Twilight Drive Sybsystem
- GRIP generated vision pipeline included
- SmartDashboard output values of NavX Yaw and Gyro Raw.

## To be done

- ~~Check navX status updates~~
- ~~Generate working GRIP pipeline~~
- Test GRIP latency when running on driverstation wirelessly
- Implement Network table reads to find the value of contours.
